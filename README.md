the completed Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report

•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client is worked for in this project was Artemis Financial. The company has software that needs to be upgraded with newer security algorithms. This will allow the software to stay safe while sending data across the internet. We are enabling the software to use Https and all secure connections possible.
•	What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I did what I do best, research. I researched many algorithms and check to see which one best fit the client (Artemis Financial) problem. I also looked to ensure that the algorithm I choose was at least a standard and minimum to government standards. We code securely to keep our code clean and updatable (patch security holes). Keeping a company secure and safe makes other customers want to keep doing business. Companies want to know that the other companies doing business are not being hacked which can cause lawsuits. Programmers in the industry must keep our clients safe, as that also can cause use issue. To be known as the ones that helped hacker bring down a company can make use lose business and seem unprofessional. 
•	What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
Understanding the vulnerability assessment at first was a little confusing. After a while, it became second hand. The second part I found difficult was false positives. When we generate a list, we expect that list to be complete. Learning that the generated list has issues (false positives) is like taking a COVID test and getting a positive then waiting and testing again to get a negative. At that point I see the test as useless, but the false positives are not useless and can be suppressed. One thing that I found good about the vulnerability assessment, was that sites maintain a list of all vulnerabilities. We can go and check out when we run into problems or if we need to find upgrades. 

•	How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
To secure the layers of security, I used the keytool to create certificates that use RSA algorithms. The RSA algorithms are used to create public and private keys to secure exchanges between computers over the internet. I would let the customer know that they need to use HTTPS as this secures the transmission. In the future, the customer needs to maintain the minimal standard per the government. 
•	How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured the code and software applications were functional, secure, and working by testing over and over to ensure everything works seamlessly. Throughout the testing I would check maven to ensure that the dependencies are up to date. Any issues in maven would be corrected, disabled, or suppressed if its needed. I would also limit the use of any dependencies that show up with problems not found. 
•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
As many certificates I created and signed, I would have to say I am a certificate master. Another tool I used many times is maven, which is a little hard to edit because you have to find and change many labels to match. All open labels must have similar closed labels, or it renders the POM file inoperable. A third tool is Eclipse, which helps me write, check, and build my project. Eclipse also allows me to use the certificates and makes maven tool available. All these tools are future able. 
•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would send them this project, as it shows I can monitor dependencies, test, and build dependencies. The project shows I can research and create certificates and make sure they are available in the keystore. I can view and edit items in the keystore, also move them to different locations so I can add them to projects. The completion of my project shows I can create and complete reports.
